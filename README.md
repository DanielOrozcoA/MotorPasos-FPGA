# Stepper FPGA
## Description
In this project, using an ALTERA CYCLON IV FPGA, the number of steps to be executed by a stepper is controlled, making it travel a specific length in centimeters. The selection of distances is carried out using four different buttons for 3, 5, 7 and 9 centimeters. After reaching the desired distance, the motor automatically returns to its starting position.
